# TrendTrack

A progam built with pandas, yfinance, and numpy that builds you a portfolio to meet the market index. Built in a team of 4 as a final project for a finance and data analytics class.

## What it Does

* Reads in a CSV file of tickers and sorts and cleans them to ensure only high-volume stocks are used
* Assigns weights to every stock using finance metrics like market capitalization and tracking error to find the stocks that best match the market
* Makes some cool graphs that show performance, correlation, and returns of generated portfolio to track performance and inform the user

## What we Used

* Python in Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas for data processing and cleaning
* YFinance for stock data
* NumPy for financial calculations
* Matplotlib for visualization
